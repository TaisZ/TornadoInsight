TornadoVM currently supports array of primitive Java types
as well as some object types such as VectorFloat, VectorFloat4 and
all variations with types as well as matrices types.
<p>
  The full list of data structures supported is in this
  <a href="https://github.com/beehive-lab/TornadoVM/tree/master/
  tornado-api/src/main/java/uk/ac/manchester/tornado/api/collections/types">link</a>
</p>

<p>
  Those are the objects that TornadoVM knows their memory layout. TornadoVM generates
  specialized OpenCL code for those data structures. For example, VectorFloat4 generates accesses
  using OpenCL vector types (float4). This might speed-up user code if the target device contains
  explicit vector units, such as AVX on Intel CPUs or vector register on AMD GPUs.
