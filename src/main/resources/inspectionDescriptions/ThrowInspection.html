TornadoVm does not support for Traps/Exceptions
<p>
  On GPUs there is little support for exceptions. For example, on a <br />
  division by 0 scenario, the CPU sets a flag in one of the special <br />
  registers. Then the Operating System can query those special<br />
  registers and pass that value to the application runtime (in this <br />
  case, the Java runtime). Then Java runtime handles the exception.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  However, there is no such mechanisms on GPUs <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/floating-point/index.html#differences-from-x86">(link)</a><br />
  which means that TornadoVM must insert extra control-flow to <br />
  guarantee those exceptions never happen. Currently, since <br />
  TornadoVM compiles at runtime, many of those checks can be<br />
  assured at runtime. However, we plan to integrate exception <br />
  support for TornadoVM in the future.
